I have used Java\nto write the application and Maven as the build tool.</p>\n<h4>Maven Build Tool</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/index.html\">Maven</a> is a popular build tool that\nautomates the build process of application. I have used Maven for the first time\nin my project. The learning curve was steep. But after I leaned some basic\ncommands, it was easy to compile and test the application.</p>\n<h4>Color Output in Terminal</h4>\n<p>Color output in terminal was new to me. I used an open source library for this\npurpose. The library supports Java +8, Linux, macOS, Windows 10. This was\nperfect for color outputting text across platforms. Here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/dialex/JColor\">GitHub Repo</a> and\nhere is the <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.diogonunes/JColor\">Maven Repo</a>.</p>\n<h4>Open Source Licensing</h4>\n<p>I have added MIT License to my project. I have yet to learn details about\ndifferent licenses.</p>\n<h4>What’s Next</h4>\n<p>The application has lots of room to improve. Currently, I am making the HTTP\nrequest asynchronously using the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html\">HttpURLConnection</a>class.\nBut, I have found a new library for doing that in more efficient way. It is\ncalled async-http-client. See their github repository here <a href=\"https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client\">https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client</a>.\nMoreover, the project is open to any contribution.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blink- A command line tool to find broken URL","date":"September 25, 2020","description":"Blink is my first open source project.
