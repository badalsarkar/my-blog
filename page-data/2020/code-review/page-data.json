We needed to use GitHub for this purpose. My code\n<a href=\"https://github.com/badalsarkar/Blink\">https://github.com/badalsarkar/Blink</a> was\nreviewed by <a href=\"https://github.com/eunbeek\">eunbeek</a>. He found an issue in my code\nthat it was printing some wrong output. I figured it out. It was happening due\nto the difference in tab character in windows and linux terminal. I fixed the\nissue <a href=\"https://github.com/badalsarkar/Blink/issues/1\">https://github.com/badalsarkar/Blink/issues/1</a>. There is another issue.\nThe color output is not working in the windows command line. The library I used\nfor color output is <a href=\"https://github.com/dialex/JColor\">JColor</a>. The library is\nsupposed to work both in Windows terminal and Linux Terminal. However, it is not\nworking in Windows. So, I need to find out how how the library works for Windows\nterminal.</p>\n<p>I also reviewed enubeek’s code. To start with, I forked his repo and then\ncloned it in my local machine. Then I followed his instruction in readme file.\nHowever, I was not able to run the code in my machine. He developed his\napplication in a windows machine and used an external library called <a href=\"https://github.com/java-native-access/jna\">jna</a>.\nBut, the library was not working in my machine. So, I filed an issue at\nenubeek’s repository.</p>\n<p>Overall, the I learned how to test someone else’s code in my machine and file\nissues related to the code. It happened to me several times that some of the\nlibraries I used for my other work, did not work as expected. But I was not\ncomfortable enough to file an issue. But now, with this practice, I am more\ncomfortable than before to test the code and file an issue. Also, enubeek’s\nreview of my code was really helpful. Because I did not test my code in windows\nmachine. While it was working as expected in linux machine, it broke in Windows\nmachine. Without enubeek’s help, it would have been not possible to find this\nso easily.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Code Review","date":"September 25, 2020","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/starting-open-source-development/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Starting Open Source Development"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/blink/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blink- A command line tool to find broken URL"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"51a9c279-561e-5ecc-9e45-ebcc84e0088c","previousPostId":"fcc26125-7552-548d-9c7a-e177096f9315","nextPostId":"9627c3af-8081-58d9-be16-c5f5e4d75bea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
