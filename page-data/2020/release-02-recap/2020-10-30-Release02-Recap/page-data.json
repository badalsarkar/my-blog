I did not know many git commands. As of today, I have completed four\nPRs in three different open source projects and working on two more. I have\nlearned and used several git commands and many functionalities of GitHub, used\nnew libraries and build tools. My goal was to work on Java projects as I am\ntrying to enhance my Java skill. In the beginning, it was overwhelming to search\nthrough different repositories and find an issue I could work on. I was looking\nfor something familiar to me as I was kind of afraid to take on something big\nand not able to do it. However, now I feel more confident that I can work on\nbigger issues.</p>\n<h4>My PRs</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Project</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Issue</th>\n<th align=\"left\">PR</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Type of work</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki\">SirLich/Bedrock-Wiki</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki/issues/185\">https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki/issues/185</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki/pull/186\">https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki/pull/186</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Page Update</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw\">Bennyboer/Thaw</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/issues/62\">https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/issues/62</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/pull/64\">https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/pull/64</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Enhancement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly\">PayPal/Butterfly</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues/360\">https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues/360</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/pull/361\">https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/pull/361</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Bug Fix</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly\">PayPal/Butterfly</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues/214\">https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues/214</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/pull/362\">https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/pull/362</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Bug Fix</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly\">PayPal/Butterfly</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues/314\">https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues/314</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Working on it</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Enhancement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/hub4j/github-api\">Hub4j/Github-Api</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><a href=\"https://github.com/hub4j/github-api/issues/937\">https://github.com/hub4j/github-api/issues/937</a></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Working on it</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Enhancement</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I loved working on all these projects. I learned something new from each of\nthese. However, working of PayPal/Butterfly was a bit more challenging among others.\nThe code base is large and I had to write tests for my work.</p>\n<p>I found open source community very welcoming, and I can learn a lot. This is just\nthe beginning, and I am hungry to do more work on open source projects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Release 0.2-Recap","date":"November 01, 2020","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/dealing-with-change-request/2020-10-30-Release02-Dealing-With-Change-Request/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Release 0.2- Fixing Bug and Dealing with Change Request in Open Source Project: Butterfly"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/working-wit-telescope/2020-11-6-Working-with-telescope/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Working with Telescope and Integrating Blink"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"51b61d71-b18d-5417-b6c9-18ab2dd5b129","previousPostId":"2996438d-50a7-53f9-83e0-d170af13e421","nextPostId":"d8734943-d0c0-532d-9e37-970286db2dcc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
