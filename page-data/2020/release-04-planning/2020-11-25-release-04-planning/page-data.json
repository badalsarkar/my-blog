As part of OSD600 curriculum I have worked on\nrelease\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/topics-in-open-source-2020/wiki/release-0.1\">0.1</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/topics-in-open-source-2020/wiki/release-0.2\">0.2</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/topics-in-open-source-2020/wiki/release-0.3\">0.3</a>\nduring last three months. Each release made us work on open source projects. I\nstarted release 0.1 without any knowledge of working in open source project. In\nrelease 0.3, I have implemented a logging framework replacing existing framework\nin PayPal/Butterfly project. I feel good about my progress.</p>\n<p>Release 0.4 requires us to work on bigger issues in open source project- may be\nto implement a new feature or fix a bug. I have three repositories in my mind\nfor this release- <a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly\">PayPal/Butterfly</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/questdb/questdb\">Questdb</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/domokane/FinancePy\">FinancePY</a>. Questdb and FinancePY is\ncomplete new to me. So, I think it will take sometime to understand the\ncode base. On the other hand, I have already worked with Butterfly and I know\nthe code base well enough to work on bigger issues. Therefore, I will work in\nButterfly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Butterfly is an application code transformation tool, and commonly it is used\nto perform automated application migrations, upgrades and source code and\nconfiguration changes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was going through the <a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement\">issues labeled as\nenhancement</a>\nand found many of them interesting. There were three issues which were related\nto the logging functionality of the application. I have just implemented a new\nlogging framework. This is yet to be merged as the maintainer was in vacation.\nSo, I won’t be able work on these issues.</p>\n<p>At this point, looking at the open issues were not helping me to pick one. I\ndecided to read more about the application on how it works. So, I headed over to\nthe <a href=\"https://paypal.github.io/butterfly/\">website</a>. I tried the application\nmyself and it gave me a better understanding of the application.</p>\n<p>Coming back to the issues, I could better understand some of the feature\nrequests. At the core of the butterfly there is transformation template and\nextensions. Everything happens based on these. There are some issues related to\nthese part of the application. I am currently looking at the following feature\nto see if I will start working on it.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/d56b5/butterflySupport.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 60.75949367088608%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Butterfly support \"\n        title=\"Butterfly support \"\n        src=\"/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/f058b/butterflySupport.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/c26ae/butterflySupport.png 158w,\n/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/6bdcf/butterflySupport.png 315w,\n/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/f058b/butterflySupport.png 630w,\n/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/40601/butterflySupport.png 945w,\n/static/b95ce8bd98e2c494a0fe1b345256e228/d56b5/butterflySupport.png 1215w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I am going to post update on the issues I am working later this week.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Release 0.4: Planning","date":"November 25, 2020","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/butterfly-bug-fix/2020-11-22-butterfly-bug-fixed/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PayPal/Butterfly Bug Fixed, Finally"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/testing-ci-workflow/2020-11-27-testing-and-ci-workflow-blink/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Implementing Testing and CI Workflow in Blink"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fbba5e8b-e5ff-557b-b477-54fe87a5677e","previousPostId":"c45217c6-6b02-522b-b862-f168eca93783","nextPostId":"aad0c412-9d99-5f5c-a22e-33f2f1b86dda"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
