This\njourney started because of OSD600 course of Seneca College. This 4 months were\nthe most exciting of my entire college life. I have contributed to a few\nprojects including a <a href=\"https://github.com/paypal/butterfly\">project maintained by\nPayPal</a>. I have learned many new skills. In\nthis blog I am going to talk about some of the benefits of contributing to open\nsource projects. You may also achieve these benefits by working on open source\nprojects. Also I am going to share my thoughts on deciding on which project to\nwork.</p>\n<h3>How open source projects helped me</h3>\n<p>4 months ago I had no clue how to use Git and GitHub properly let alone\ncontributing to a project. Today, I have the confidence that I can work on\nfixing complicated bugs, implementing a new features, navigating large code\nbase, working with other- more experienced developers and many more.</p>\n<h4>Experience</h4>\n<p>I think this one is the most crucial for new developers. All jobs ask for some\nsort of experience in development and new developers usually struggles to get\nexperience. Of course, if I don’t get a job how do I get experience. We do\npersonal projects to showcase our skills. This is great. Open source projects\ncan help to get development experience. There are tons of projects and\ntons of things to work on. Big companies also have open source projects. If you\nwork on any of these projects, you can write that in your resume which will\ndefinitely add value.</p>\n<h4>Understanding the code</h4>\n<p>When we build our own application, we are the one who decide on the code\nstructure. If there is a bug, we can find it out and solve it comparatively\neasily. Because it is our code. But in job we are not going to write all the\ncodes ourselves. We will be working with code written by others, probably, maintain\nalready written code which is in production. To fix a bug or implement a new\nfeature in existing code is tough. If the code base is unknown and large, it is\ntougher.  Navigating the code base, understanding how different components are\ninteracting with one another is a crucial skill. You need to develop this in\norder to make any change confidently, in the production code base. A college\nstudent don’t get the chance to work on projects like this. You can master this\nskill by working on open source projects. Big projects, used by many people, are\nout there. You can get the code in your computer, look at the code base, work\nwith it. You can learn how big companies organize their projects, how they write\ncodes.</p>\n<h4>Learning new tools, technologies and concepts</h4>\n<p>There are so many tools and technologies out there. Which one should I learn?\nThis question used to pop up in my mind now and then. I was very confused.\nNow, I think that apart from fundamental stuffs, you learn what you need for your\nwork. It has happened to me so many times that I have learned something new\nthen I have forgotten it after one month because I did not use it. Or the\nlearning process was hard because there was no application of that\nknowledge. Working in open source projects helps in this respects too. So\nfar I have learned about <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html\">Java modular\nsystem</a>,\n<a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html\">Gradle</a>,\n<a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html\">Maven</a>, Git, GitHub, GitHub\nActions, <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/\">Log4j2</a>,\n<a href=\"http://logback.qos.ch/\">Logback</a>, <a href=\"http://www.slf4j.org/\">SLF4J</a>,\n<a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/intro\">Kafka</a>,\n<a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/\">Junit</a> to name a few.\nThere are many other smaller things. This will add up. The best part is\nthat I can retain my knowledge because I have learned it as part of my work\nand I have used it. I have learned by doing.</p>\n<h4>Reading documentation</h4>\n<p>I have seen this twitter last month-</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c5a0638b6bc15cf17b05a1bde94618f9/7527b/twitter.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.68354430379746%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Twitter post about documentation\"\n        title=\"Twitter post about documentation\"\n        src=\"/static/c5a0638b6bc15cf17b05a1bde94618f9/f058b/twitter.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c5a0638b6bc15cf17b05a1bde94618f9/c26ae/twitter.png 158w,\n/static/c5a0638b6bc15cf17b05a1bde94618f9/6bdcf/twitter.png 315w,\n/static/c5a0638b6bc15cf17b05a1bde94618f9/f058b/twitter.png 630w,\n/static/c5a0638b6bc15cf17b05a1bde94618f9/7527b/twitter.png 754w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>We all have our favorite weapon. I feel that for newbie developers, reading\nofficial documentations is the least favorite weapon. It is intimidating to read\nthe documentations. But this is just for a few times. If you read the\ndocumentations you get a clear picture of how that specific thing works. For\nexample, when I read someone’s answer about how to use an unknown function in\nJava, may be I get how I should write it in my code. But when I look into the\ndocumentations, I get whole lot of information like whether the function throws\nan exception which I need to  handle. When you work on open source projects,\noften you deal with something new, like a weired bug or using a new\nlibrary. In those cases, you will find yourself reading the documentations\nvery often. After a few times, official documentations will be your favorite\nweapon. Of course, not all projects have good documentations. I have\nstruggled with this several times.</p>\n<h4>Your code reviewed by other developers</h4>\n<p>The code you contribute to open source projects are reviewed by other\ndevelopers. This is a great opportunity to learn from other, more experienced\ndevelopers. Don’t get upset when you see a review request on your code. This is\na learning opportunity. This also helps improve communication skill- getting\nyour ideas through.</p>\n<h4>Confidence build up</h4>\n<p>As newbie developers, we often suffer from lack of confidence. At least that is what\nhappened to me. I used to think what would it be like to work with production\ncode. Can I do it? What if I break something? How do I know for sure that I have\nnot broken something? I also didn’t have the courage to approach an open source\nproject maintainer and say that I would like to contribute. Working in a few\nprojects have boosted my confidence. Now, I have the confidence to handle\ncomplicated bugs and implementing new features. It may take time but I will get\nto the solution.</p>\n<h4>Networking</h4>\n<p>The most important factor to get a job is networking as we know 80% jobs are\nhidden. We network in different platforms and forms. To me the best person to\ntalk about my work is the one who I have worked with. Others will also put more\nweight on that person’s word. In open source projects, you are working with\nother developers who are seeing your work, evaluating your work. When a\ndeveloper talks good about your skill, what do you think it will do? You might\nget an OFFER.</p>\n<h3>How should I choose which project to work in</h3>\n<p>This depends on what you want to achieve. I will share my decision criteria so\nit may give some points to consider. I decided to improve my Java skill.\nSo, I looked for Java projects. Among many I decided to work on projects\nmaintained by large companies as this will look good on my resume. I did not\nchoose projects where there are hundreds of developers. This is because I\nwas just starting out. There is no reason why you should not contribute to\nprojects where there are many developers. Next, I decided to focus on one or two\nprojects so that I can make big contribution like implementing new feature. To\nme it seemed better than making contributions to many projects.\nOnce I have enough confidence, I will go out to pick another project and put\nsignificant contribution. Don’t get me wrong, in open source all contributions\ncount. This was just my preference.</p>\n<p>This is my achievement and learning so far from open source projects. I am\nreally loving it. I can see myself contributing to more projects in future and\nblog about it.
