It was for\nimplementing a feature in his project. He accepted my PR and merged my change in\nhis project.\nIt felt amazing to be able to collaborate with someone and make a project better.</p>\n<h4>The Process</h4>\n<p>In a nutshell, if you make any changes in any repo in GitHub, you create a PR to\ntell others about the changes. Before my first PR, I always wondered about the\nprocess. How should I start working on a project and request for my changes to\nbe merged to the main project? The process is really simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>\n<p>Read the instructions first. Many projects will have instructions on how to\ncontribute to the project. Follow those instructions while making any change.\nIf there is no instructions, you can reach out to the project owner or repo\nmaintainer and ask your questions. In general, for changes in the code, follow\nthe same pattern as in the original code.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>\n<p>Fork the repo by clicking the Fork button.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 491px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/22290b2fd3ad59e7fb433570e1454001/13566/fork.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 21.51898734177215%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAj0lEQVQY042Pyw7CIBBF+UxNNNEf19iWtkaNxba8huY60GBwpYuz4Fy4M4jN7oBfbPfHv72gsMBTgHX+g/PEjpKPGOuST2fOKKz3vzxFv0DkB7XscDpf0LQdZm0wzxrjOEFzVjUtIzGxGwaVCu+PJ6paor/euNRBqReIu0TcJk7Rxiby1JLoysz51WXKn70BgvQSZ46g/j8AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Fork\"\n        title=\"Fork\"\n        src=\"/static/22290b2fd3ad59e7fb433570e1454001/13566/fork.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/22290b2fd3ad59e7fb433570e1454001/c26ae/fork.png 158w,\n/static/22290b2fd3ad59e7fb433570e1454001/6bdcf/fork.png 315w,\n/static/22290b2fd3ad59e7fb433570e1454001/13566/fork.png 491w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Forking basically means copying the repo to your own account. The original repo\nthat you forked is called <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code> and your copy of the repo is called\n<code class=\"language-text\">origin</code>. You can make any changes in the origin and push it without affecting\nthe <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code>. Usually you will have only read access to the <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>step 3:</strong></p>\n<p>Clone the repo to your computer.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>\n<p>This is very important step. Before you make any changes in the project, you\nshould create a branch so that your changes are isolated from the <code class=\"language-text\">main</code> branch.\nGive a descriptive name to the branch so that it tells what the branch is for.\nCheckout to the branch and run all the tests. This is super important. Before,\nyou start working, you should make sure that the project is working as\nexpected. Not all the projects will have test cases. In that case, just\ntry running the application and see if it is working.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>\n<p>Make your changes. Again, follow the instructions if any or maintain consistency\nwith existing code base.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6:</strong></p>\n<p>Test the application with your changes. If there are existing tests, you can add\ntest case for your change. Run all the tests and make sure all of them passes.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 7:</strong></p>\n<p>Commit your code with good commit message. I use a template for writing my\ncommit messages. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/lisawolderiksen/a7b99d94c92c6671181611be1641c733\">Here</a>\nis a template.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 8:</strong></p>\n<p>Once your are done with your work, you can push the changes to your origin with\nthe command <code class=\"language-text\">git push origin {your branch name}</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>\n<p>Open a pull request. You can open pull request from <code class=\"language-text\">origin</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">upstream</code>. Be\nsure to put all relevant information in the pull request. Once the project owner\nreviews your code they might merge it with <code class=\"language-text\">main</code> branch or provide you feedback\nif they want to change something if your work.</p>\n<p>Throughout the entire process, be sure to communicate with the project\nowner if you have any questions.</p>\n<h4>The Work</h4>\n<p>Following the above steps, I have made my first <a href=\"https://github.com/VietnameZe/insane-cli/pull/7\">PR</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/VietnameZe\">Huy\nNguyen’s</a> project called\n<a href=\"https://github.com/VietnameZe/insane-cli\">insane-cli</a>. He wrote this\napplication which checks whether an URL is valid or not. This was done as part\nof the OSD600 <a href=\"https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/topics-in-open-source-2020/wiki/release-0.1\">course work</a>.\nI wanted to implement a feature which will search a webpage in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\">WayBack\nMachine</a>. I sent Nguyen a message stating how I would\nlike to implement the feature. Once he agreed, I followed the above mentioned\nsteps to implement the feature and create a pull request. Once Nguyen received\nmy pull request, he reviewed it and found some issues. After that, me and Nguyen\nworked together to resolve the issue and finally he merged my change to the\n<code class=\"language-text\">main</code> branch.</p>\n<h4>My Learning</h4>\n<p>Going through this process, gave me confidence in working on someone else’s\nproject. This is great as it broke the barrier and now I am looking forward to\nworking on different open source projects.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First PR (Pull Request)","date":"October 02, 2020","description":"I made my first PR a few days ago."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/blink/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blink- A command line tool to find broken URL"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/working-with-git-branch/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Working with Git Branch"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7e388faa-d2c7-5b79-81de-ab94891c1b57","previousPostId":"9627c3af-8081-58d9-be16-c5f5e4d75bea","nextPostId":"3b0b206d-3e37-5c5c-b898-a779e6e3a787"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
