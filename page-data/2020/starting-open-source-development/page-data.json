In the financial industry Microsoft Excel is used\nextensively and thus Visual Basic for Application (VBA) is also used for various purposes. So, I started to learn VBA\nmyself. Later, I automated three processes at my department, and the impact was significant in terms of reduction of\nprocessing time. The processing time was reduced by approx. 70% on average. In addition to that, the occurrence of errors\nwas also significantly reduced. This achievement gave me motivation to learn programming more seriously. So, I left\nmy job in 2018 and took admission at Seneca College Computer Programming and Analysis Program.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am learning Spring framework and working on a personal project with it. Apart from coding, I love reading\nbooks.</p>\n<h3>Open Source Development</h3>\n<p>I became interested in open source development because I mostly use open source\nsoftware, and I have used open source libraries in my projects. It sounds great\nto be able to contribute to the software or libraries I use or other people use.\nIn addition to that, open source projects are huge learning source.</p>\n<p>So, I joined the Open Source Development(<a href=\"https://ict.senecacollege.ca/course/osd600?q=course/osd600\">OSD600</a>)\nat my college.</p>\n<p>The course seems very interesting as it is not designed to be taught traditionally.\nIt is focused more on learning by doing. As part of the\ncourse, we will be working on open source projects on GitHub. Students will also\nbe exposed to the tools and techniques used in real world development. These\nwill help students to become job ready after they finish college. I am very\nexcited to learn all these and specially to work with open source projects.</p>\n<h3>My Progress So Far</h3>\n<p>This blog is my first progress mark. As part of this course, we need to write\nabout what we are doing on weekly basis. This is my first blog.</p>\n<p>I have also explored GitHub for trending repositories, and I have cloned the\nfollowing repositories.</p>\n<p><strong>Spring Framework\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework\">GitHub</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>I have forked this repository because I have been leaning Spring framework for\nthe last one month. I understand the basic building blocks of the framework, and\nI am also working on a personal project using this framework. So, looking at the\ncode of the framework will help understand the framework better and how it works\nunder the hood. This is also a great learning opportunity. In addition to that,\nI will look for opportunities to contribute to the framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture\nViewer(<a href=\"https://github.com/capitalone/architecture-viewer\">GitHub</a>)</strong></p>\n<p>This project is maintained by Capital One. This project converts <a href=\"https://plantuml.com/\">PlantUML</a>\ndiagrams into interactive HTML architecture diagrams. I got interested in this\nproject because I use PlantUML for my diagramming purpose. Recently, I\nhave been thinking about a personal project which is related to PlantUML. So, I\nwill look into the code. Maybe I can use it in my project, or I can contribute\nto this project.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting Open Source Development","date":"September 17, 2020","description":"Welcome to my first blog.
