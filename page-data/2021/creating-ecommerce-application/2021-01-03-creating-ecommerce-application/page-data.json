For this project I am using Spring Boot for\nconfiguration, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Lombok, PostgreSQL and React.</p>\n<p>Spring boot makes it very easy to start a Spring framework application by doing all the necessary configurations behind\nthe scene. Spring Web MVC provides support for creating web applications. Spring Data JPA is another project of Spring\nwhich is an implementation of Java Persistence API(JPA). It uses Hibernate under the hood. The benefit of using it is\nthat it provides implementations for many CRUD operations out of the box. Project Lombok goes a great length to reduce\nboiler plate code. Based on annotations it can generate a constructor, getter, setter etc. PostgreSQL is my database and\nReact will be used for developing front-end.</p>\n<p>I am also using Spring HATEOAS to build hypermedia based rest service. </p>\n<p>I am going to use GitHub projects to manage this and Jenkins for CI/CD. I have created <a href=\"https://github.com/badalsarkar/amazingshop-server\">GitHub repo</a>\nfor this project. </p>\n<p>This is just a high level overview. I will write in detail about everything in coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Next step is to create some design documents before jumping into code.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creating an E-Commerce Web Application","date":"January 04, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/my-opensource-journey/2020-12-10-my-open-source-journey/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"4 Months of Open Source Development"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"061ee14d-1b2c-586c-96a3-64d30ff76204","previousPostId":"2e40993e-f049-5555-a42f-555201c54d62","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
