In the month of October, I have participated in the
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) as part of [release
0.2](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/topics-in-open-source-2020/wiki/release-0.2).
The goal was to complete 4 PRs in open source project and write blog
post about the work.

Before this month, I had little or no knowledge on contributing to open source
projects. I did not know many git commands. As of today, I have completed four
PRs in three different open source projects and working on two more. I have
learned and used several git commands and many functionalities of GitHub, used
new libraries and build tools. My goal was to work on Java projects as I am
trying to enhance my Java skill. In the beginning, it was overwhelming to search
through different repositories and find an issue I could work on. I was looking
for something familiar to me as I was kind of afraid to take on something big
and not able to do it. However, now I feel more confident that I can work on
bigger issues.

I loved working on all these projects. I learned something new from each of
these. However, working of PayPal/Butterfly was a bit more challenging among others.
The code base is large and I had to write tests for my work.

I found open source community very welcoming, and I can learn a lot. This is just
the beginning, and I am hungry to do more work on open source projects.
