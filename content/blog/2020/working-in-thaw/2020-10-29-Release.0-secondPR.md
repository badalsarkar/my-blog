I have implemented a new feature in an open source project called
[Thaw](https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw).

The maintainer of the project wanted to implement [this](https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/issues/62)
feature which will expose a sub-command to clear the cache.

After doing some research on the project I found that there is a class called
`CacheUtil` which deals with the caching activities. So, a good solution would
be to add a function in this class to clean the cache directory. So, I added the
following function-

<script src="https://gist.github.com/badalsarkar/72de575724ace81fc40b660e352422dd.js"></script>

I have used the
[`FileUtils`](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/javadocs/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html)
class of [Apache Commons IO](https://github.com/apache/commons-io)
library.

Now, I needed to add a sub-command `clean` in the command line options. Thaw
used [picocli](https://picocli.info/) for building the command line interface. I
added the following function to implement the sub-command-

<script src="https://gist.github.com/badalsarkar/5d2e1fac7db07d591b91e3c213fa4459.js"></script>

In addition to the changes in the code, I also updated the [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE](https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/blob/master/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICE.md) to
include the attribution for Commons IO library.

After I am done with my changes I committed the change and opened a [pull request](https://github.com/bennyboer/thaw/pull/64).

There were couple of things that I worked with for the first time in the
project. Thaw used [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as build tool. I used gradle
for the first time. The project was organized using [Java Platform Module
System(JPMS)](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html).
I have also used [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) as Java version
manager.
