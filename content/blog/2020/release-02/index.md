I have worked on this [repository](https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki),
as part of my release 0.2. This repository was for a website built with Jekyll.
I worked on this [issue](https://github.com/SirLich/bedrock-wiki/issues/185)
which was to update the website by adding a link. The issue was fairly simple.
However, I had to read about how the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) works.

To build Jekyll sites, we can write our content in markdown format. In this
particular issue, one page was missing a link. So, I updated the page with the
link.

This was my first ever PR in the open source development world. I wanted to
start with something small to understand how the overall process works. My
learning from this work is that we should always communicate with the project
maintainer. They provides information about the project which makes it easier to
start the work.
