Visual Basic for Applications was my\n            first programming language. So far, I have worked with C, C++, Java,\n            JavaScript and Python. Now a days, I am focusing more on Java and\n            Python. In Java, I am working with Spring framework and in Python, I\n            am focusing on fundamentals. My primary learning mode is by reading\n            books and technical documentation. I learn more effectively this way\n            rather than watching tutorials.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I don't have any favorite language or technology. I like to consider\n            them just as tools to solve some problems. When solving a problem, I\n            will pick the most suitable tool.\n          </p>\n          <h4>How I started programming</h4>\n          <p>\n            Till 2018, I was a banker, working at CIBC, Toronto, Canada. After\n            completing my Master's degree in Finance, I started my career in\n            2010 as a banker in my home country, Bangladesh. Throughout my\n            career, I had a passion to solve problem and make processes easier\n            and efficient. While working at Mutual Trust Bank, Bangladesh, I\n            implemented several process improvements and automated some\n            regulatory reporting systems. My interest led me to self-taught\n            Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which is used extensively for\n            streamlining excel workflows in the Banking industry in Canada. With\n            my knowledge of coding, I started to look for opportunities to put\n            my skill into work. During my employment period at CIBC, I have\n            improved several processes including semi-automating a\n            reconciliation system and transaction entry into core banking\n            software.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This achievement encouraged me to look into the coding stuff. So, I\n            started with HTML, CSS at{\" \"}\n            <Link to=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\" target=\"__blank\">\n              freecodecamp.\n            </Link>\n            Later, in early 2018, I started to think more seriously about\n            programming and was considering to go back to school. Due to my\n            family situation, it was not possible to continue both my job and\n            school. So, I decided to leave my job and focus on studying. It was\n            a tough call. But I believe, I made the right decision.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Today, I absolutely love programming. Solving a problem, gives me\n            the highest satisfaction.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </React.Fragment>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default About\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
